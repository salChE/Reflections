How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It narrows down the search and pinpoints the location of the change.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    This provides peach of mind knowing that you can go back and make changes at any time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pro is that you logically can figure out why the changes were made. The con is that you might forget to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    This might be because a lot of code is interdependent and need to be considered as a whole.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will give you a list of the commits with comments. git diff will compare to commit id numbers and show
    exactly what was added and deleted.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    With git checkout of course!!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To collaborate with others and keep a record of my work.
